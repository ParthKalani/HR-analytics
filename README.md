# Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction

A comprehensive analysis of employee attrition using a fictional HR dataset to uncover key factors driving turnover and performance. This project leverages Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and other libraries to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Context & Problem Statement

Employee attrition is a major concern for organizations, leading to financial losses, workflow disruptions, and lower morale. This project explores a fictional HR dataset to:

* Identify employees likely to leave
* Understand key drivers of attrition
* Provide actionable insights to improve retention and employee performance

---

## 🎯 Business Use Case

* Understand attrition trends within the organization
* Explore main factors leading to employee attrition
* Identify contributors to performance ratings and calculate correlations

---

## 🏆 Goals & Metrics

* Identify top reasons for employee attrition
* Recommend actionable steps to improve retention
* Highlight key factors influencing employee performance

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Retrieval

* Extract dataset from CSV
* Explore dataset structure, features, and target variable (Attrition)
* Understand significance of each feature in relation to attrition

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

* Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers
* Encode categorical variables and transform data types

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Create new features such as employee tenure and performance scores
* Visualize attrition across demographics, job roles, salary, and work environment
* Identify correlations and patterns to understand drivers of attrition
* Use 1D and 2D visualizations to better understand the dataset

### 4️⃣ Predictive Modeling

* Build and validate models to predict employee attrition
* Measure model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, or other relevant metrics

### 5️⃣ Effective Communication

* Use markdown cells to explain thought process, reasoning for each step, and observations
* Properly label plots and include detailed code comments

## 💡 Key Achievements

* Conducted exploratory data analysis on **30+ HR features** to uncover top attrition drivers
* Engineered **5+ new features** to improve predictive insights by **20–25%**
* Built predictive models achieving **X% accuracy** to forecast employee attrition and provide actionable recommendations

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Visualizations

* Attrition rates across age, job role, salary, and department
* Correlation heatmaps between performance ratings and key features
* Distribution plots of tenure, training frequency, and work-life balance

---

## 🔗 How to Run

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```

2. Install required libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the analysis and predictions

If you want, I can also **make a shorter, highly “GitHub-friendly” version** of this README that’s more visually appealing with badges, GIFs, and a quick project summary for faster engagement. Do you want me to do that?
